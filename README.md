This repository showcases hands-on threat hunting CTFs, focusing on detecting, analyzing, and responding to real-world attacker techniques. It includes hypothesis-driven hunts, log analysis, KQL queries, MITRE ATT&CK mappings, and documented findings. The goal is to demonstrate practical threat hunting skills, analytical thinking, and a structured approach to uncovering stealthy threats in modern environments.
