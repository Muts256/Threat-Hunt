## Scenario
Your organization recently completed a phased deployment of an internal platform known as CorpHealth — a lightweight system monitoring and maintenance framework designed to: 
 
  - Track endpoint stability and performance
  - Run automated post-patch health checks
  - Collect system diagnostics during maintenance windows
  - Reduce manual workload for operations teams 

CorpHealth operates using a mix of scheduled tasks, background services, and diagnostic scripts deployed across operational workstations.

To support this, IT provisioned a dedicated operational account.

This account was granted local administrator privileges on specific systems to: 

  - Register scheduled maintenance tasks
  - Install and remove system services
  - Write diagnostic and configuration data to protected system locations
  - Perform controlled cleanup and telemetry operations

It was designed to be used only through approved automation frameworks, not through interactive sign-ins.

### Anomalous Activity 

In mid-November, routine monitoring began surfacing unusual activity tied to a workstation in the operations environment.

At first glance, the activity appeared consistent with normal system maintenance tasks:
 health checks, scheduled runs, configuration updates, and inventory synchronization.

However, a closer review raised concerns:

  - Activity occurred outside normal maintenance windows
  - Script execution patterns deviated from approved baselines
  - Diagnostic processes were launched manually rather than through automation
  - Some actions resembled behaviors often associated with credential compromise or script misuse

Much of this activity was associated with an account that normally runs silently in the background.

### Your Role 

You are taking over as the lead analyst assigned to review historical telemetry captured by: 

  - Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
  - Azure diagnostic and device logs
  - Supporting endpoint event artifacts 

You will not have live access to the machine — only its recorded activity.

Your task is to determine: 

- What system was affected?
- When suspicious activity occurred?
- How the activity progressed across different stages?
- Whether the behavior represents authorized automation or misuse of a privileged account?
